# Superconducting Quantum Circuits using scQubits

This repository is the contribution to scQubits documentation under the UnitaryHack 2023!
You can see the entire contribution with the first video at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChefdJWovYc    

This is the repository for the second video on how to implement the circuit quantization with scQubits. You can see the video on Youtube:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv3nLKb66OE   

I hope you find this very helpful, and I hope to submit more codes in the future!  
Best,
